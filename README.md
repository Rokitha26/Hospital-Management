# Hospital-Management
So, here's the deal—this is a hospital website, but not the boring, ancient ones that look like they were coded in 1998 by someone who hates colors. Nah, this one's got some style. It's responsive, which means it actually works on your phone (shocking, I know). I built it with good ol' HTML, CSS, and straight-up JavaScript—no fancy frameworks, just the basics turned up to eleven. You get your classic homepage, all shiny with banners and those “click me!” call-to-action buttons, plus pages for services, doctors, contact info, and a few more thrown in for good measure. Basically, it’s a playground for anyone who wants to mess around with front-end design, layout, and making stuff actually do things when you poke it.

## What’s Inside?
- Multi-page setup, and yeah, it actually looks good on your phone or tablet
- Eye-catching homepage—think banners, service teasers, buttons begging for clicks
- About Us, Services, Doctors, and Contact pages, because every hospital site needs those or it’s basically a blog
- Slick navigation bar up top, footer down below (because, you know, websites)
- Loaded up on images to make everything feel a bit more legit
- Mobile-friendly from the ground up—no endless pinching and zooming

---

## Nerdy Stuff (a.k.a. Tech Stack)
- Plain HTML5 (no weird templating languages)
- Modern CSS3—lots of flex, lots of grid, none of that float nonsense
- Good ol’ vanilla JavaScript (the real MVP)
- A bunch of images and icons to spice things up

And that’s pretty much it. Not rocket science, but it actually looks and works like a real hospital site. Give it a whirl if you wanna flex your front-end muscles or just need something that won’t embarrass you if your mom asks to see what you’re working on.
